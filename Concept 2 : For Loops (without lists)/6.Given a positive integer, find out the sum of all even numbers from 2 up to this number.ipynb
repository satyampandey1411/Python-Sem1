If integer is greater than or equal to 2  then we will ittrate a for loop in the range of 2 to integer+1(integer included) with a jump of 2, and assigned a variable even_summation whose value is initialised 0. Each time when for loop is ittrated the even_summation get added by i. If integer is less than 2 then will will say that even_sum is 0.\n",
