    "Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), find the slope and intercept of the line joining these two points (the line may be perfectly horizontal or vertical).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we will check whether x2-x1 is 0 or not. If x2-x1 is equal to zero we say that slope and intercept is not defined because the line joining the two points become parallel to y axis. If x2-x1 is non zero then we will calculate slope and intercept by the formula Slope=(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) and  Intercept=y1-(slope * x1)\n",
