    "    We will check x and y coordinate of point with these 9 conditions\n",
    "    (i) x1 and y1 both are greater than 0 then point is lying in Ist quadrant\n",
    "    (ii) x1 is lesser than 0 but y1 is greater than 0 then point is lying in IInd quadrant\n",
    "    (iii) x1 and y1 both are lesser than 0 then point is lying in IIIrd quadrant\n",
    "    (iv) x1 is greater than 0 but y1 is lesser than 0 then point is lying in IVth quadrant\n",
    "    (v) x1 is 0 and y1 is greater than 0 then point is lying in Positive Y axis\n",
    "    (vi) x1 is 0 and y1 is lesser than 0 then point is lying in Negative Y axis\n",
    "    (vii) x1 is greater than 0 and y1 is 0 then point is lying in Positive X axis\n",
    "    (viii) x1 is lesser than 0 and y1 is 0 then point is lying in Negative X axis\n",
