    "We will calculate the LCM of positive no only. By using if and else codition we will find the larger no and then We will assign a variable named LCM =1 and then we will calcute the LCM by using for loop in the range int1 multipled int2 to larger-1 with a back jump of larger. And then we Will print the LCM as LCM*i at the last.\n",
