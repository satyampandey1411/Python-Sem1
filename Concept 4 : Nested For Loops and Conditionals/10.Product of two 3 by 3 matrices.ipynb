    "Given two 3x3 matrices with values stored in two lists of length 9, find their product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have given two mitrix with a length of 9, so we will consider first three elements of the list as 1st row and the next three as 2nd and last three as 3rd row. We have calculated the matrix multiplication of (mat1 X mat2) by taking one row from the mat1 and multiplying it with a column of mat2 and adding corresponding multiplications inside these 3 multiplications. Every row of mat1 is multiplied by all three different columns of mat2. Just reversing the way we get the mat2 X mat1.\n",
