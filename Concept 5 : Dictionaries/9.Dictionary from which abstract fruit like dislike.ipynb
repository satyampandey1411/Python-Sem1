    "**Question9:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary whose keys are the names of your family members and friends, and the values are the list of fruits they like to eat. Now if the user gives a fruit as input, the code should print the list of names who like this fruit. Write another code to print the list of people who do not like this fruit. Using this dictionary as input, write a code to make a consolidated list of all the fruit names present in the values of various keys. This list should not have any duplicate entries. Do not use the set() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic:**\n",
    "First of all we will separate the store the names of member who like the fruit given in input in a list named Fruit_like and also store the name of the member who don't like in another list named Fruit_dislike by using for in in the dictionary named dict_family. Then we will create an empty list named Fruit_list_unique in which we will add all the name of fruit one time by using for loop and if fruit not present in Fruit_list_unique then appending the fruit name.\n",
